# droidsheep-2.0 Readme file

Hello Guys,

since the original DroidSheep doesn't work anymore, I thought it will be a good idea to work on a stable 2.0 release.
So, the main goal is to make DroidSheep work again. However, it does not work right now on Android 5.1.
Right now I've got enough extra free time to work on DroidSheep 2.0

# What is DroidSheep?

See: http://droidsheep.de

Basically it spoofs login data of an insecure (none SSL) connection and gives you the ability to use an active session cookie for yourself.
Right now I'ld call this Build an 0.0.0.0.1 alpha, so please be patiente with me and this project. 
I'll work very hard on this thing and hope to make it work on newer devices any time soon.

Information: This software is neither made for using it in public networks, nor for hijacking any other persons account.
It should only demonstrate the poor security properties network connections without encryption have.
This repo was an original Google Repo and was 1:1 copied to GitHub.
DroidSheep was originally created by Andreas Koch - http://droidsheep.de and is licenced as an Open Source project.
